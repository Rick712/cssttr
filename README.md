# README

This is the course repository for 'CSS to the rescue'.

The goal of this course is to make a highly accesable website for someone who only uses tab and enter to navigate through the website. I need to accomplish this without using classes and id's for styling, and without using Javascript for the behaviour of the website. Only elements selectors and pseudo selectors are alowed.

Live version of the website is on https://rick712.github.io/cssttr
