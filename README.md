# README

This is the course repository for 'CSS to the rescue'.

The goal of this course is to make a responsive, and highly accesable website for someone who has a disability. I was not alowed to use Javascript for the behaviour of the website. I neither was allowed to use classes and id's for styling. Only element selectors and pseudo selectors are alowed. The goal of the course is to learn how powerfull selectors are, and to learn how to make a website for someone with a disability, in this case someone with spasm. This person mainly uses tab and enter to navigate through the website. This means that I don't need to use hover states, but focus states as main interaction.

Live version of the website is on https://rick712.github.io/cssttr

## The website
Since the content of the website didn't matter, I decided to make a website that is all about exposing the truth about chickens. Users of the site can write and read articles that other people wrote. Of course, the website itself doesn't work since the goal of the course is not to make a working web app, but to learn how to style for someone that navigates with tabs.

### Components
Part of the task was to include some components to the website that weren't necessarily usefull for the site, but were quite interesting to work with. The components are:
- A main navigation
- A login form
- A section with a header, an image and text
- A section with a linkable header and an image
- A chat
- A rating system
- And a step indicator

### Terms
There were also a few required techniques. These were:
- A fancy ampersands
- De-emphasize by dimming
- De-emphasize by blurring
- Intrinsic sizing
- Styling by sibling count (optional)
- Vertical centering
- Loading spinner
- Transitions on :hovers and :focus
- Custom cursor on element
- Extending the clickable area
- Custom checkboxes
- (Pseudo)random background
- Validation of a form

All these techniques are based on the book CSS SECRETS: Better solutions to everyday web design problems by Lea Verou.

### Main functions
Of course, the back end of the website does not work, but you can still navigate through the website. The pages you can visit are:
- index.html
- profile.html
- chat.html
- /pages/maanlanding.html

There are also a few hashes that have a particular function:
- #login
- #menu
These are working on every page, and can be triggered by clicking on certain menu items.

When you want to check the website out, be sure to to to these adresses.
